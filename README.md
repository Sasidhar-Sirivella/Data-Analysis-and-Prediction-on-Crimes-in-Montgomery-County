BACKGROUND

Crime in the United States has been recorded since colonization. Crime rates have varied over
time, with a sharp rise after 1963, reaching a broad bulging peak between the 1970s and early
1990s. Since then, crime has declined significantly, and current crime rates are approximately
the same as those of the 1960s. (Source: wiki)
Overall, the number of crimes of all kinds reported in the United States remained fairly flat last
year after a three-year increase, according to an annual FBI report. But while crimes against
property were down, physical assaults against people were up, accounting for 61 percent of the
7,120 incidents classified as hate crimes by law enforcement officials nationwide. State and
local police forces are not required to report hate crimes to the FBI but the bureau has made a
significant effort in recent years to increase awareness and response rates. Still, many
cities and some entire states failed to collect or report the data last year, limiting the conclusions
that can be drawn from the FBI report.
Montgomery County is the most populous county in the U.S. state of Maryland, located adjacent
to Washington, D.C. As of the 2010 census, the county's population was 971,777. As of July 1,

highest percentage (29.2%) of residents over 25 years of age who hold post-graduate

OBJECTIVE

Our study aims to find spatial and temporal criminal hotspots using a set of real-world datasets
of crimes. We intend to perform extensive exploratory data analysis that will help us understand
the factors affecting the crimes such as crime locations, timeshifts, response time etc., Based on
the preliminary analysis and feature selection, we intend to predict the average response time
3
for a given crime and also predict crime rate based on temporal data. Finally, we provided an
analysis/ suggestions by combining our findings that would help the officials to make decisions
accordingly in order to improve the safety of Montgomery County.
